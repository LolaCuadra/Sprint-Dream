# Development Environment
In creating the Minesweeper game, we employed Python as the primary programming language, leveraging the Pygame library to streamline graphics and user interaction. The development environment included an organized project folder structure and a chosen IDE for code editing.

A key feature was the implementation of a high-score system, where player achievements were stored securely in a MongoDB database using PyMongo. This not only allowed for efficient data management but also facilitated the retrieval and display of top scores within the game.

Testing and debugging were integral to ensuring the game's functionality, and version control tools, like Git, were considered for efficient collaboration and code tracking. Clear documentation accompanied the project, providing insights into the codebase, structure, and dependencies.

Ultimately, the integrated environment, with Pygame for game development and MongoDB for high-score storage, created a robust foundation for a polished Minesweeper game.
