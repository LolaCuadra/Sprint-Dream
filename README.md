What the project does
We are making Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a puzzle game where you try to select a square that does not contain a bomb. Once a square is selected, it shows a number which is equal to the number of bombs adjacent to the square. You win by clearing every square except for the bombs.

Why the project is useful
Minesweeper trains pattern recognition, flexibility, and logic. It also acts as a way to distract your brain from difficult situations which helps reduce stress.
