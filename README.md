# Development Environment
we developed the Minesweeper game using Python as the programming language, with Pygame as the game development library. Visual Studio Code served as my chosen code editor, and we utilized Git for version control. The project folder included separate directories for Python scripts and images. External resources, such as mine and flag images, were integrated into the game. Testing and debugging were performed using print statements and Pygame's debugging features.
